        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Sift flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir the mixture until
                    blended, then sift a second time into another bowl.</li>
                <li>Place shortening in a mixing bowl and beat until creamy. Gradually mix in white sugar. Beat in egg
                    and dark molasses until light and fluffy. Sift 1/3 of the flour mixture into the shortening mixture;
                    stir to thoroughly blend. Sift in the remaining flour mixture and mix together until a soft dough
                    forms.</li>
                <li>Pinch off small amounts of dough and roll them into 1-inch-diameter balls between your hands. Roll
                    each ball in cinnamon sugar, then place 2-inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are rounded and slightly cracked, about 10 minutes. Cool
                    cookies on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container.</li>
