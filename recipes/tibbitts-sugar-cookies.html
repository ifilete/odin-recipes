        <p>This recipe was handed down from my great grandmother. It took a few years to figure out the exact measures.
            These cookies are very soft and if you want to use a cutter, the dough should be refrigerated a couple
            hours. I use a three inch biscuit cutter. You can also drop these if you are short on time. Sprinkle tops
            with colored sugar or whatever decorative confection you like. These are good plain also. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup lard</li>
                <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, cream together the lard and sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the
                    buttermilk. The mixture will be very runny at this point. Combine the flour, baking soda, nutmeg and
                    salt; stir into the buttermilk mixture by hand using a wooden spoon. Try not to over mix the dough
                    or the cookies will be dense. Drop by spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. For cut out
                    cookies, the dough should be refrigerated for a couple of hours. Roll out to 1/2 inch thickness and
                    flour your cookie cutter between each cut.</li>
                <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes
                    before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
